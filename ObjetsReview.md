### Q5. javascript-simple-objects-2

Create two objects:
1. An object called **whiteRabbit**, containing as property a variable named **type**. Make this variable equal to *white*.
2. An object called **fatRabbit**, also containing as property a variable named **type**. Make this variable equal to *fat*.

Write a function called **whatKindOfRabbit** which accepts as an argument an object called **rabbit**. Make the function log to the console the *type* property of the object, like this:


```
This is a ______ rabbit
```

### Q6. javascript-simple-objects-3

Create two objects:
1. An object called **cat**. This object will contain the properties **kind** ("cat") and **age** (2);
2. An object called **mouse**. This object will contain the properties **kind** ("mouse") and **age** (20);

Write a function called **whoIsWiser** that accepts two objects as arguments: **firstAnimal** and **secondAnimal**. Have the function compare the **age** property of the two objects. If the age is equal, it
will print out
```
These two are equal in wisdom.
```
 If the age is not equal, it will print out:

```
The [older animal] is wiser than the [younger animal]
```

Call the function with the following variables:
1. mouse, cat.
2. cat, mouse.
3. cat, cat.
4. mouse, mouse.

### Q7. javascript-simple-objects-4

You are given the following code:
```javascript
var mouse = {
    name: "French Mouse",
    words:[ "Would YOU like cats if you were me?",
          "As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear their name again!",
          "Nothing. The mouse is leaving."]
}

var girl = {
  name: "Alice",
  words: [ "Oh, I beg your pardon! I quite forgot you didn't like cats. ",
         "Well, perhaps not. We won't talk about cats any more if you'd rather not.",
         "I won't indeed! Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?"]
}
```

write a function called **dialogue** that would accepts as arguments two objects, **speaker1** and **speaker2**. Inside the function, log to the console **words** arrays of both speakers as follows:


- [ speaker 1's **name** ] + " says " + [ speaker1's **words[0]** ]
- [ speaker 2's **name** ] + " says " + [ speaker2's **words[0]** ]
- [ speaker 1's **name** ] + " says " + [ speaker1's **words[1]** ]
- [ speaker 2's **name** ] + " says " + [ speaker2's **words[1]** ]
- ...

Assume that both **words** arrays are of the same length. However, you do not know the length of these arrays in advance.

### Q8. javascript-simple-objects-1

Create an empty object called **rabbit**. Add a function called **speak** as a property to your object. This function will accept a single argument and log to the console "The rabbit says: " followed by the argument. Call the function with the string "Can I have some lettuce?".

The output should look like this:
```
The rabbit says: Can I have some lettuce?
```

<!-- @acxbank obj-length -->
### Q9. obj-length

Write a function called `objSize` that takes this object as its input and return the object's size (number of properties in the object) as its output.

Example:
```js
var student = {
  name : "Tony Stark",
  university: "MIT",
  Major: "Physics",
  age : 40
};

objSize(student); //returns 4
```

### Q10. javascript-simple-objects-5

You are helping create a simple text-based role playing game. The Following code is given:

```javascript
var player1 = {
    name: "Player",
    attack: 2
}

var monster1 = {
    name: "Goblin",
    hp:10,

   /*
    *    Call this function when the monster gets hit. It will log the monster's remaining hp to the console
    *    @arg damage - the number to be substracted from the monster's hp
    */
    gotHit: function(damage){
        // If damage would bring hp to less then zero, setting hp to zero
        this.hp = (this.hp - damage >= 0) ? (this.hp - damage) : (0);
        // Printing out how much hp the monster has left
        console.log(this.name + " has " + this.hp + " hp");
    },
    // Call this function to check if the monster is dead
    isDead: function(){
        return this.hp === 0;
    }
}
```

Write a new function `fight(player, monster)`

In this function, the player will hit the monster until it is dead. Before each hit, log to the console:
```
[The player's name] hit [the monster's name]
```
 When the monster is dead, log to the console:
```
[The monster's name] has been defeated
```

Use the given functions of **monster1**.
